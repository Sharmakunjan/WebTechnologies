  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Kunjan Sharma. I am currently studying computer science in Herald College. I have completed my +2 from Reliance Int Academy taking Major as Biology. So, Computer Science was a new and interesting course for me to study. At the first of the semester, it was very difficult for me to learn IT as I had come from biological field. Slowly I started learning and with the help of my friends and tutor it started going smoothly. Till now I have got basics knowledge about computer science. I have learnt the basic programming language and I can also write simple programs of Java and python languages. I also have knowledge about the fundamentals of programming, which includes data types, variables, control Structure and algorithms. I have also learnt about CPU, ALU, Memory and others. I have also learnt basic about website development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have learnt about database and about the architecture of computer system and how the various components of a computer work together. My other basics core skills include problem solving, study skills, communication, time management, critical thinking and many more.  </p>
  <p>Taking about my plans, my focus is built to strong foundation in one of the programming languages I will be building a strong portfolio of projects to show my skills and experience to future clients. 
    Before taking any project, I will be taking internships and co-operation opportunities in my upcoming future. As it is important to have experience of the real world. It will also help me to make connections with the industry as it is important factor for the completion of any projects. In the future I will also Pursue an advanced degree in computer science as it will help me to gain specialized knowledge and skills in a specific area. Till now, I have thought about pursuing AI as my advanced degree course which will help me to be more competitive in the job market and also a great way to challenge myself professionally.

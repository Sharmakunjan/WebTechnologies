<p>I have completed my 10th with G.P.A of 3.45 on the scale of 4 from Bagmati Boarding Higher Secondary School. I have always had a keen interest in Science and technological field; hence I choose to study Science (include subjects such as Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, English, etc.) along with Computer science in 12th grade. I completed my 12th grade form Reliance International Academy pass out of 2021 with G.P.A of 3.35 on the scale of 4 in the NEB board exam.
  And the field I am interested to study in my bachelor level is  BSc (Hons) COMPUTER SCIENCE specifically AI, Data Analytics.
  </p>
<p> I always had a great inspiration for pursuing technical career. It all started when we got computer at our home when I was a kid and I distinctly remember the time when I was unable to detach from the computer as there were numerous things going on which was out of my knowledge and ever since then I began to explore and witness many things revolving around it and hence convinced me to pursue my career on computer science. The technologies are always evolving every seconds and as a result it is safe to say it has a very bright future which will also help me to build up my standard career as I would have access to wide and variety of work aspects with high amount of earning. We are living on fast paced technological era that has changed the way we live our life and I am assertive that computer technology will have the same or even drastic impact on our life on near future. Hence, it was natural for me to pursue Computer science course on competitive international environment.
